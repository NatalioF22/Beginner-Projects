    Problem
    Write a program to simulate the lottery game. The program should firstly prompt for four single-digit winning
    numbers and then prompt for four single-digit lottery numbers. Each digit in the number is in the range between 0~9.
    The program should determine which prize the user wins according to the following rule:
    • The user wins the first prize if all of the input numbers and the lottery numbers match in exact order.
    • The user wins the second prize if any three of the input numbers and the lottery numbers match in exact order.
    • The user wins the third prize if any two of the input numbers and the lottery numbers match in exact order.
    • The user wins the fourth prize if any one of the input numbers and the lottery numbers matches in exact order.
